# vue-app-electron
A Vue Cli 3 plugin for Electron with no required configuration that uses Electron Builder. 

IMPORTANT: Your app must be created with Vue-CLI 3 (vue create my-app), will not work with Vue-CLI 2 (vue init webpack my-app)!

Quick Start: Open a terminal in the directory of your app created with Vue-CLI 3.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```
That's It! You're ready to go!

#To start a development server: If you use Yarn (strongly recommended):
```
yarn electron:serve
```
#If you use NPM:
```
npm run electron:serve
```

That's It! You're ready with your first electron-vue demo app hurrah!!! It's Super easy isn't it?
